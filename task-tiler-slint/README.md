# Task Tiler Client

## Overview

The Task Tiler Client, currently available as a desktop application, enables users to visually manage the tasks sent from Logseq via the [Task Tiler Plugin](../task-tiler-logseq). It displays tasks as tiles, sized in relation to how much time has been allotted for them, making it easy to view and manage them.
