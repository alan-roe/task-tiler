# Task Tiler

## Overview

Task Tiler integrates task management with Logseq through a client and a Logseq plugin, connected via MQTT. The client visualizes tasks for efficient management.

## Components

-  [**Task Tiler Client**](./task-tiler-slint/): A desktop application for interacting with tasks.
-  [**Logseq Plugin**](./task-tiler-logseq/): Converts and transmits Logseq tasks to an MQTT broker for the client.

## Development Plans

- [ ]   Something other than MQTT as server
